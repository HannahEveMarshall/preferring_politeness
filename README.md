# Preferring politeness: Young children's implicit comprehension of linguistic politeness
This is a project repository for an Honors project conducted in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University.

## Synopsis
Adults routinely demonstrate social sensitivity by employing polite speech. Being suitably polite involves masterfully applying an inventory of linguistic forms to various social and situational contexts. The complexity of this ability brings into question when children begin to comprehend linguistic politeness. Existing literature indicates that basic comprehension of polite speech presents early in development; however, previous studies have not observed reliable preference for a polite speaker in children younger than 4 years (Yoon & Frank, 2019), potentially due to experimental task demands. This project uses a less challenging paradigm (adapted from similar shape-preference paradigms; Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007; Thomas & Sarnecka, 2019) to investigate the age at which children acquire an understanding of polite speech. Our data showed that collectively, 2-year-old, 3-year-old, and 4-year-old children indicate preference for a polite speaker above chance. In addition to informing our understanding of children’s socio-linguistic and socio-pragmatic development, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a more accessible paradigm for future studies of linguistic politeness in young children.
