## Synopsis
Adults routinely demonstrate social sensitivity by utilizing polite speech. But when do children begin to comprehend linguistic politeness? Existing literature indicates that basic comprehension of polite speech presents early in development: by 3 years, children accurately judge whether a speaker is more polite, ruder, nicer, or meaner than another based on the speaker’s use of polite speech (Yoon & Frank, 2019). By 4 years, children reliably opt for play partners who use politeness markers; however, previous studies have not observed reliable preference for a polite speaker in children younger than 4 years, potentially due to experimental task demands. This project proposes a less challenging paradigm (adapted from similar shape-preference paradigms, i.e. Hamlin, Wynn, & Bloom, 2007; Thomas & Sarnecka, 2019), which may detect preference for a polite speaker in children younger than 4 years. In addition to informing our understanding of children’s sociolinguistic development, this study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of a simpler paradigm for future studies of politeness in young children.
