# Introduction

To engage in successful social interactions, an individual must demonstrate social sensitivity. The same individual must assess the social sensitivity of others to determine the desirability of their social partners. The capacity to evaluate individuals on the basis of their social interactions is universal and unlearned (Haidt & Joseph, 2004; Hamlin et al., 2007; Hauser, 2006; Pinker, 2002). Even preverbal infants develop social preferences based on individuals’ behavior toward others (Hamlin et al., 2007). Through development, humans learn to routinely demonstrate and assess social sensitivity by employing and interpreting linguistic politeness in speech.

Linguistic politeness can be defined as a set of social behaviors, expressed verbally, which maintain, enhance, or challenge interpersonal relations (Vergis & Pell, 2017). It is a form of social etiquette, which regulates the choice of communicative forms, structures, and set phrases a person uses (Ryabova, 2015). Being polite is considered a part of adult pragmatic competence, and the rules include, Don't impose, Give options, and Make the addressee feel good (Lakoff, 1973).

When speaking politely, individuals typically do not behave rationally in accordance with Gricean Maxims: in fact, polite speech violates theories of effective communication by typically being inefficient and under-informative (Grice, 1975; Yoon et al., in press). Then why speaking politely? A utility-theoretic approach to speech acts suggest that polite speech emerges from a tradeoff between three competing goals of communication: to convey information (informational utility), to be kind (prosocial utility), and to present oneself in a good light (self-presentational utility) (Yoon et al., in press).

## Composing a Polite Utterance

Speaking with an appropriate degree of politeness comes intuitively to most adults; however, formulating an adequately polite utterance is a fairly complex process. Ervin-Tripp (1977) asserted that two factors affect the production and comprehension of polite register: knowledge of the linguistic form of polite requests and knowledge of pragmatic request rules within a given social and situational context. Figure 1 expands on these two factors by illustrating what an adult with normative socio-pragmatic competence typically considers before producing a polite utterance.

![Considerations when selecting a polite utterance.](C:/Users/Hannah/Desktop/preferring_politeness/figures/diagrams/contextual_considerations.jpg)

In selecting a polite utterance, an individual must first consider the interpersonal context of their interaction. To be appropriately polite, the individual must vary their level and form of politeness depending on the difference between their own and their interlocutor’s ages, genders, and social statuses. For example, it may be more appropriate for a younger person to speak more politely to an older person than vice versa, and it may be more appropriate for a male to speak more politely to a female than to another male. Similarly, a person of high social status may speak with a level of politeness that is indicative of their sophistication but also does not compromise their face.

After considering the interpersonal context of their interaction, a person must consider the degree of politeness which is appropriate for the unique social setting. For instance, a sense of urgency makes it more appropriate to opt for the imperative (and less polite) phrase “Call an ambulance, now,” as opposed to asking, “Ms. Smith, when you have a moment, would you mind calling an ambulance, please?”

After considering the interpersonal context and social setting of their interaction, a person must consider the cost of their request and decide how informative they want to be, how kind they want to be, and how informative and kind they want to present themselves as. In doing so, the person must determine their ideal, balanced weightings of the informational, social, and self- presentational utilities of their utterance.

Then, the individual must consult their internal inventory of politeness markers and selectively compose an utterance which is appropriate for the social setting, interpersonal context, and content of their request, as well as satisfies their desired utilities.

Finally, the person must weigh the cost of their utterance. If the cost is reasonable, then the person would make the utterance, and if the utterance is too costly, the person would return to their inventory of polite language to compose a less costly utterance.

At each step in this process, the speaker must not only judge the literal meaning of their utterance; they must also predict the listener’s interpretation to ensure that their utterance effectively communicates the intended message. Thus, the production of polite speech can be understood through a Rational Speech Act framework, characterized by recursive reasoning.

According to this framework, the speaker chooses to produce a polite utterance based on their prediction of how a listener would interpret it, and the listener being reasoned about interprets the utterance by reasoning about the speaker's prediction, and so on (Yoon et al., in press).

## Acquisition of Politeness

Being suitably polite involves masterfully combining an understanding of social and contextual factors with an inventory of linguistic forms. The complexity of this ability brings into question when and how humans being to acquire polite speech.

Production of polite speech begins early in development: At two years old, children modify their requests to adjust politeness (Bates & Silvern, 1977), and at two and a half years old, children produce "please" (Read & Cherry, 1978). By three years old, children are able to vary their utterances based on whether they are instructed to "tell" versus "ask" an addressee to give them a puzzle piece (Bock & Hornsby, 1981). By three years old, children also possess several politeness formulas in their repertoires and use them spontaneously and appropriately quite frequently in their home context (Eisenberg, 1982).

Evidence from studies on children’s understanding of politeness indicates that that children understand the implications of polite speech early on: By three years old, English- speaking preschool children can correctly identify whether a person is nicer, meaner, more polite, or less polite than another speaker, based on which speaker includes politeness markers such as "please" in their requests (Yoon & Frank, 2019). By four years old, English-speaking preschool children tend to choose polite speakers as play partners over non-polite speakers and understand that polite speakers are more likely to have their requests granted (Yoon & Frank, 2019). However, previous studies have not observed reliable preference for a polite speaker in children younger than four years, potentially due to experimental task demands (busy stimuli, excessive auditory input, high attention demands, etc.).

## The Current Study

This study proposes a less challenging task based on existing shape-preference paradigms (Hamlin et al., 2007; Thomas & Sarnecka, 2019), which may detect preference for a polite speaker in children younger than four years. We are testing two-year-old, three-year-old, and four-year-old children’s implicit understanding of linguistic politeness by assessing their preference for a polite speaker over an impolite speaker.

### Hypotheses

1. Considering our less challenging task, we predict that two-year-old, three-year-old, and four-year-old children will indicate preference for a polite speaker over an impolite speaker (i.e. the proportion of children in each age category who indicate preference for a polite speaker will differ significantly from chance).

2. Considering evidence for graded comprehension of politeness in young children (Yoon & Frank, 2019), we predict that children will indicate preference for a polite speaker over an impolite speaker more reliably (i.e. with a stronger effect) with increasing age.

# Methods

## Participants

Participants include two-year old (n = 20), three-year-old (n = 20), and four-year-old (n = 20)	children living in the U.S. at the time of data collection. Participants are recruited through the Department of Psychology at Stanford University through Facebook advertisements, Children Helping Science (an online recruitment platform for developmental research), and direct outreach to preschools and daycares in the Bay Area.

We selected our sample size based on a Bayesian power analysis conducted in R (see OSF registration for code). Our lowest-power tests were by-age-category Bayesian binomial tests. To detect an effect in which 80% of children indicate preference for a polite speaker with 80% power and a 95% credible interval, we must run 15 participants in each age category (45 total). We are running 60 participants to compensate for exclusions and missing data. A second power analysis showed that with 60 participants, across age categories, we could detect an effect in which 70% of children indicate preference for a polite speaker with 80% power and a 95% credible interval.

A child is excluded from the study if:

1.	The child is known to have any cognitive, auditory, or visual impairment, and the impairment is reported by the parent.

2.	The child is known to have any neurodevelopmental disorder that significantly affects cognitive processing or social cognition, such as down syndrome or autism spectrum disorder, and the disorder is reported by the parent. Attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are only grounds for exclusion if the child is unable to adequately complete test trials due to inattention or restlessness as per criterion 6.

3.	The child does not hear English “all of the time” or “most of the time” as indicated by the parent upon registration.

4.	A non-participant (e.g. the child’s parent or sibling) interjects or interferes by pointing at the screen at any time during the experiment, audibly commented, or providing a response to either dependent variable measure (DV).

5.	The child fails to provide a response to DV1 after four prompts.

6.	The child is looking away from the screen for at least 25% of the animation.

7.	The child is looking away from the screen during either speaker utterance.
 
8.	The parent rates the video or audio quality below a 3 out of 5.

Parents are also asked to report their child’s gender, their child’s race, their child's first language, and whether their child has siblings. These data may be used in exploratory analyses.

## Stimuli

The animation begins with a (secondary) familiarization phase in which a shape (the speaker) enters from the left of the screen, spots two cookies on the opposite side of the screen, gasps excitedly, approaches the cookies, eats one cookie, and celebrates by jumping up and down. This phase informs the participant that the speaker’s goal is to eat a cookie.

A testing phase follows in which the speaker enters from the left of the screen and stops in front of another shape (the listener), who is standing in the way of the cookies. In the polite condition, the speaker says, “I am so hungry! May I have a cookie please?” In the impolite condition, the speaker says, “I am so hungry! Give me a cookie now.” Regardless of condition, the listener moves out of the speaker’s way. The speaker gasps excitedly, crosses in front of the listener, approaches the cookies, eats one cookie, and celebrates by jumping up and down.

Utterances used in the animation were prerecorded. Intonation was naturalistic and did not include exaggerated “polite” or “impolite” prosody. Utterances were cleaned using Audacity (an audio editing and recording software) and RMS was standardized across conditions using Praat (a phonetics software).

The background consists of a solid, green block and solid, blue block depicting grass and sky. The listener is always a blue circle. The polite and impolite speakers consist of either a red triangle and yellow square or a yellow triangle and red square. The shape of the speaker (triangle/square), color of the shape (red/yellow), and order of the conditions (first/second) are counterbalanced across trials.

## Randomization

A generic list randomizer was used to assign the first 16 participants in each age category to one of 16 unique animations (without repeats), which accounted for all necessary counterbalanced conditions. The same generic list randomizer was used to assign the remaining 4 participants in each age category to one of the 16 unique animations (without repeats).

## Procedure

Children complete the study on their family’s home or personal computers with an experimenter online via Zoom (a videotelephony software). A parent must provide either written consent via email or verbal consent prior to testing. The attending parent is notified that they or their child may stop participation at any time. Testing sessions are recorded with parental consent. Each session begins by testing audio quality and calibrating the participant’s screen settings.

The experimenter begins with a warm-up activity to build rapport with the child. The experimenter plays a short "I-Spy" game with the child, during which a black and white dog emerge from behind a pile of leaves, then a brown squirrel emerges from the same pile. The animals are front-facing and centered, and the pile of leaves is symmetrical to avoid inducing side bias.

Next, the experimenter introduces the child to a green pentagon with eyes and a mouth to indicate animateness. The experimenter then shows the child what the character looks like when it “feels very sad” (downturned mouth), “feels normal” (flat-line mouth), and “feels very happy” (upturned, open mouth). The purpose of this primary familiarization phase is to introduce shapes as animate characters and to accustom the participant to facial expressions that are used in the upcoming animation.
 
After this primary familiarization phase, the animation is played. Each participant sees both the polite condition and the impolite condition as detailed above. The experimenter is not blind to condition but bares a blank expression and looks down while the animation is playing. At the end of the animation, the caregiver attending to the child is asked to close their eyes before the child’s preference and reasoning are assessed.
We measure preference between a polite speaker and an impolite speaker by presenting a forced-choice in which the speakers appear on opposite sides of the screen (counterbalanced) and the participant is asked, “Which friend do you want to play with?” (DV1, our key DV).

Pointing, reaching, and verbal answers are coded equivalently as indication of preference. If a child does not answer, the child is prompted three more times with analogous wording. If the child does not provide an answer, the session is concluded.

If the child provides an answer, the child is asked, “Why do you want to play with that friend?” (DV2, which may be used in exploratory analyses). If the child does not provide an answer, the child is prompted twice more.

Including screen setup and debriefing, each session takes 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Children nor parents are financially compensated for participating in the study.

## Coding

Where age is categorically described, it is coded to consist of three levels:

*	2-year-olds (2 years, 0 months ⩽ x < 3 years, 0 months)

*	3-year-olds (3 years, 0 months ⩽ x < 4 years, 0 months)

*	4-year-olds (4 years, 0 months ⩽ x < 5 years, 0 months)

DV1 (preference) is dummy coded with preference for the polite speaker as 1 and preference for the impolite speaker as 0.

DV2 is coded to include:

1.	No reasoning: no explanation after a third prompt (e.g. silence, shrugging, or “I don’t know”).

2.	Superficial reasoning: any explanation regarding elements besides speaker utterance (e.g. “I like him”, "He's red", "Triangles are my favorite").

3.	Logical reasoning: any explanation that refers to speaker utterance and is consistent with the animation (e.g. describing the polite speaker as “nice” or “polite”).

4.	Other reasoning: any explanation that does not fall under classifications 1 – 3.

## Analyses

After data collection is complete, we will run a Bayesian binomial test from the BayesianFirstAid package in R to assess whether the proportion of children in our sample who indicated preference for a polite speaker differed from chance.

We will run three more Bayesian binomial tests from the BayesianFirstAid package in R to assess whether the proportion of children in each age category who indicated preference for a polite speaker differed from chance.

We will also run a Bayesian logistic regression models from the rstanarm package to model speaker preference (DV1) as a function of age.

Our study will use pairwise deletion. If a child does not complete DV2, their DV1 data will be included in analyses. If a child does not complete DV1, that child will be excluded from analyses.
 
Two-tailed tests will be used for each of our analyses. All data-based outliers will be included in analyses.

## Inferences

We will make inferences based on credible intervals, using a 95% credible interval criterion for success.

# Results

We assessed whether the proportion of children in our sample who indicated preference for a polite speaker differed from chance using a Bayesian binomial test. We 58% of our entire sample indicated preference for a polite speaker.

A logistic regression predicting speaker preference based on age showed a slightly positive--but not substantial--overall effect of age: Every 12-month increase in age predicted an increase of .1 in the probability that a child will indicate preference for a polite speaker.

Our data showed much more variation than was captured by our logistic regression (Figure 1). To capture this variation, we faceted out data by age category (two-year-old, three-year-old, and four-year-old children), and we assessed whether the proportion of children in each age category who indicated preference for a polite speaker differed from chance using additional Bayesian binomial tests. 65% of two-year-old children, 36% of three-year-old children, and 69% of four-year-old children indicated preference for a polite speaker.

# Exploratory Analyses

# Discussion

1. Replicated prior research where four-year-old children reliably indicated preference for a polite speaker, but three-year-old children did not (Yoon).

2. But showed that two-year-olds can also do this!

3. Performance of two-year-old children is comparable to the performance of four-year-olld children, indicating that there is not a substantial developmental "improvement" between two and four years: All the cognitive capacities that goes into identifying polite language, forming an opinion about the speaker, and indicating a preference based on that is present at 2 years old.

4. Three-year-old children performed much differently than expected, showing a slight preference for the impolite speaker.

    - Could be that 3-year-olds are just performing at chance. At this age, children start preschool, things like shape, color, object-referent language become salient, and things like social evaluation may be lost in the background.
            - By 4 years, children have developed a plethora of vocabulary and social evaluation, once again, become pertinent to assessing, engaging with, and relating to the people and world around them.
            
    - Or could be that children may actually be preferring the impolite speaker. 
            - There is vast and string evidence that young children prefer--and choose-- toys which function and characters who behave unexpectedly (...; ...). At two, children may recognize polite language as prosocial, and therefore prefer it; but, at three, children might be more interested in exploring the social world and thus, pick the character whose utterance is the least expected. 
            - A handful of the children giggled after the impolite speaker made its utterance. Some even credited their choice to the fact that the speaker was "funny" or "silly". Anecdotally, young children are much less upset by other's words. If this is what the children are picking up on, they may be choosing the speaker that says something entertaining.
            
## Limitations

- Context in stimuli is actually quite foreign to many children. From a very young age, if a child asks for something nicely, they get the thing, and if they ask for something rudely, they will be corrected by an adult (e.g., "What do you say?" or "What's the magic word?"). In our animation, both the polite character and impolite character's wishes were granted. This may have exacerbated any effect that was due to the unexpectedness of the impolite speaker.

- Because politeness is so broad, this study and specific scenario really only gets at children's preference for a polite speaker in a very small portion of polite phenomena

## Future directions

- Replicate results
- Study a broader range of scenarios involving politeness
- Study other aspects of politeness
