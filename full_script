# Preferring Politeness - Full Script

## Key

[P] = Caregiver’s Name

[C] = Child’s Name

[E] = Experimenter's Name

## Introduction

Hi, you must be [P]. My name is [E]; I’m the researcher who will be playing the game with your child today. 

_To child_: Hi! What’s your name? 

Nice to meet you, [C]. My name is [E] and I’m so excited to play my game with you today! Are you excited?

_Establish rapport._

## Video and Audio Effects (Calibration Part 1)

Before we play the game, I just need a few minutes to get the game all set up. But don’t worry [C]; we’ll start the game in just a few minutes.

First, I’m going to share my screen with you. Share screen. Do you see a sky with lots of clouds? _Wait for confirmation._

Next, we need to do a quick sound check. I’m going to play a short video. Give me a **big** thumbs up if you can hear it. _Play video._ Could you hear that?

## Game Information and Verbal Consent

[P], in the scheduling email, you were informed that we record these sessions just to keep track of what happens. Are you still okay if we record? 

You’re about to hear a silly robot voice, [C]. _Start recornding._ [P], you can just click “Continue” on the notification.

The game we'll play today takes about 5 minutes. [C], I'll introduce you to some of my friends. Then, we'll watch a short video and I'll ask you a couple questions at the end. And there are no right or wrong answers; the game is just for fun! Does that sound like a game you want to play, [C]? _Wait for assent._

At one point, [P], I’ll ask you to close your eyes. This is just to make sure that we’re observing what [C] thinks without your input. Are you comfortable with that? _Wait for consent._

Of course, you’re more than welcome to stay with [C] throughout the game, but we ask that you not react to, respond to, or point out anything that’s happening onscreen. But at the end, if you have any questions, I’ll be more than happy to answer them. 

_If written consent was not provided:_ In the email, you were provided with some information about consenting for [C] to participate today. To provide your consent, just read the bolded lines aloud. Before you do so, do you have any questions about the consent process or participating in research?

When you’re ready, read the bolded lines aloud, starting with “Today is [date]”.

## Screen Settings (Calibration Part 2)

You've been so patient, [C]. We just need to get the screen set up, then we'll be ready to play!

[P], what type of device are you using today: a laptop, desktop, or tablet? And do you know the approximate screen size?

Are you in full-screen mode where you can only see Zoom and this Keynote presentation, or do you see other applications onscreen as well?

_If not in full-screen mode:_ Enter full screen mode by pressing this icon (_indicate with cursor_) at the top right of your screen.

Do you see the videos of our faces on top of the screen like this (_indicate with cursor_) or beside the screen like this (_indicate with cursor_)? If they are on top, you should be able to click on them and drag them around the screen.

_If beside:_ Under “View Options” at the top of your screen, select “Side-by-side Mode”.

Do you see both of our videos on the screen, or just my video?

_If both:_ Move your cursor to the upper right corner of your video. Hover over the blue and white ellipsis and select “Hide Self View”.

We have a couple other people with us today; they're shadowing just to observe us play the game. Do you also see the non-video participants?

_If so:_ Move your cursor to the upper right corner of the other participants’ videos. Hover over the blue and white ellipsis and select “Hide Non-Video Participants”.

Finally, I’m going to have you drag my video to where this rectangle is on the screen.

Thank you for going through all those steps with me. 

Guess what, [C]! Our game is all set up!

Are you ready? Let’s get started!

## Main Study

First, I want to introduce you to one of my friends. _Advance Keynote._ This is my friend. _Advance Keynote._

_Advance Keynote._ This is what my friend looks like when he feels **very sad**. _Advance Keynote._

_Advance Keynote._ This is what my friend looks like when he feels **normal**. _Advance Keynote._

_Advance Keynote._ This is what my friend looks like when he feels **very happy**. _Advance Keynote._

_Advance Keynote._ Now, I’m going to show you a fun video of some of my other friends! Then, after the video, I’ll ask you a couple questions, okay? Let’s watch the video and listen **super closely** to what my friends say.

Are you ready, [C]? Here we go!

_Advance Keynote._

Is the video done playing? [P], would you close your eyes for this next part. But [C], you can keep your eyes **wide** open.

_Advance Keynote._

[C], which friend would you like to play with?

_If no answer:_ [C], can you point to the friend you want to play with?

_If no answer:_ [C], do you see my two friends on the screen? Can you use your finger to point to the friend you want to play with?

_If no answer:_	There are no right or wrong answers, so you can choose whichever friend you want.

_If no answer:_ That’s okay, [C]. You don't have to pick if you don't want to.

_If answer:_ Why do you want to play with that friend?

_If no answer:_ [C], why did you choose that friend?

_If no answer:_ Any reason is a good reason.

_If no answer:_	That’s okay, [C]. You don't have to answer if you don't want to.

[P], feel free to open your eyes again.

_Advance Keynote._

Guess what, [C]! That’s the end of the game! Thank you so much for watching and for listening to my friends ask for cookies!

## Debriefing and Feedback

[P], if you and [C] have a few more minutes, there are a few more questions which can help us improve the game for other children. Would that be okay? 

[C], this first question is for you. How much did you like the game today? Did you like it a little bit, did you like it a medium amount, or did you like it a lot?

Do you have any questions about the game, [C]?

Now I have a couple of questions for you, [P]. Firstly, thank you so much for having [C] take part in our research today. As you saw, [C] watched a video in which two characters asked for cookies politely and impolitely. Our study looks at whether young children prefer characters who use polite language.

Do you have any questions about the game or our research more generally?

How was the video quality?

How was the sound quality?

How engaging do you think the activity was for [C]?

_If written consent was not provided:_ Lastly, with your consent, there are a few different ways that today’s recording could be used. By default, all families begin at level 1, which means this recording is kept on our secure servers and only shown to our research team. Alternatively, you could consent to level 2 or 3, which are entirely optional. You would consent to level 2 if you would be excited for us to share [C]’s video or an image from [C]’s video in a talk or presentation, and you would consent to level 3 if you would be excited for us to use the video in more public arenas, such as a published paper or on our website to recruit other children for our research. Do you have any questions about these levels or have a sense of which one you would like to consent to today?

_If written consent was provided:_	Via email, you consented to [consent level], which indicates that you are comfortable with us using the video of today’s session [in corresponding way]. Is that right and do you have any questions about this level?

If you don’t have any further questions, that’s all I have for you today.

Thank you so much for participating. [C], it was **so** nice to meet you and I hope I see you soon to play more games!

Thank you, again. Enjoy the rest of your day.
