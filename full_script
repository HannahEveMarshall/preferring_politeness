# Introduction

Hi, you must be [P]. My name is [E]; I’m the researcher who will be playing the game with your child today. 

_To child_: Hi! What’s your name? 

Nice to meet you, [C]. My name is [E] and I’m so excited to play my game with you today! Are you excited?

_Establish rapport._

Video and Audio Effects (Calibration Part 1)

Before we play the game, I just need a few minutes to get the game all set up. But don’t worry [C]; we’ll start the game in just a few minutes.

First, I’m going to share my screen with you. Share screen. Do you see a sky with lots of clouds?

Next, we need to do a quick sound check. I’m going to play a little video and give me a big thumbs up if you can hear it. Play video. Could you hear that?

Game Information and Verbal Consent

[P], in the scheduling email, you were informed that we record these sessions to keep track of what happens. Are you still okay if we record today’s session? 

You’re about to hear a silly robot voice. [P], you can click “Continue” on the notification.

The game [C] will be playing today takes about 5 minutes. [C] will watch a video and will be asked two questions at the end. At one point, [P], I’ll ask you to close your eyes. This is just to make sure that we’re observing what [C] thinks without your input. Are you comfortable with that? 

And there are no right or wrong answers, we’re just interested in what [C] thinks.

Of course, you’re more than welcome to stay with [C] throughout the game, but we ask that you not react to, respond to, or point out anything that’s happening onscreen. But at the end, if you have any questions, I’ll be more than happy to answer them. 

Do you have any questions about this now?

If written consent was not provided:	In the email, you were provided with some information about consenting for [C] to participate today. To provide your verbal consent, just read the bolded lines aloud. Before you do so, do you have any questions about the consent process or participating in research?

When you’re ready, just read the bolded lines aloud, starting with “Today is [date]”.

Screen Settings (Calibration Part 2)

Now we just need to set the screen up. What type of device are you using today: a laptop, desktop, or tablet? And do you know the approximate screen size?

Are you in full-screen mode where you can only see Zoom and this Keynote presentation, or do you see other applications onscreen as well?

If not in full-screen mode:	Enter full screen mode by pressing this icon at the top right of your screen.

Do you see our videos in front of the screen like this (indicate with mouse) or beside the screen like this (indicate with mouse)? 

If beside:	Under “View Options” at the top of your screen, click “Side-by-side Mode”.

Do you see both of our videos on the screen, or just my video?

If both:	Move your mouse to the upper right corner of your video. Hover over the blue and white ellipsis and select “Hide Self View”.

Do you also see the non-video participants?

If so:	Move your mouse to the upper right corner of the other participants’ videos. Hover over the blue and white ellipsis and select “Hide Non-Video Participants”.

Finally, I’m going to have you drag my video to where this rectangle is on the screen.

Thank you for going through all those steps with me. 

Guess what, [C]! My game is all set up! Would you like to play my game with me? 

Are you ready? Let’s get started!

Main Study

First, I want to introduce you to one of my friends. This is my friend.

This is what my friend looks like when he feels very sad.

This is what my friend looks like when he feels normal.

This is what my friend looks like when he feels very happy.

Now, I’m going to show you a very fun video of some of my other friends. Then, after the video, I’ll ask you a couple of questions, okay? Let’s watch the video and listen to my friends super closely.

Are you ready, [C]? Here we go!

Play slides.

Is the video done playing? [P], I would appreciate it if you could close your eyes for this next part.

Click to ring bell and reveal choices.

[C], which friend would you like to play with?

If no answer:		[C], can you point to the friend you would like to play with?

If still no answer:	Do you see my two friends on the screen? Can you point to the friend you would like to play with?

If still no answer:	There are no right or wrong answers, so you can choose which one you would like to play with.

If still no answer: 	That’s okay, [C].

Why did you choose that friend?

If no answer:		Why do you want to play with that friend?

If still no answer:	That’s okay, [C].

[P], feel free to open your eyes again.

Play final slide.

Guess what, [C]! That’s the end of my game!

Thank you so much for watching and for listening to my friends ask for cookies!

Debriefing and Feedback

If you have a couple more minutes, I have some questions for both of you, which can help us improve the game for other children. Would that be okay? 

[C], this first question is for you. How much did you like the game today? Did you like it a little bit, did you like it a medium amount, or did you like it a lot?

Now I have a couple of questions for you, [P]. Firstly, thank you so much for having [C] take part in our research today. As you saw, today, [C] watched a video in which two characters asked for cookies politely and impolitely. Our study looks at whether young children prefer characters who use polite language.

Do you have any questions about the game or our research more generally?

How was the video quality?

How was the sound quality?

How engaging do you think the activity was for [C]?

If written consent was not provided:	Lastly, with your consent, there are a few different ways that today’s recording could be used. By default, all families begin at level 1, which means this recording is only shown to our research team. Alternatively, you can consent to level 2 or 3, which are entirely optional. You would consent to level 2 if you would be excited for us to use [C]’s video or an image from [C]’s video in a scientific paper or presentation, and you would consent to level 3 if you would be excited for us to use the video or images from the video in more public arenas, such as on our website to recruit other participants for our research.

Do you have any questions about these levels or have a sense of which one you would like to consent to today?

If written consent was provided:	Via email, you consented to [consent level], which means you are comfortable with us using the video of today’s session [in corresponding way]. Do you have any questions about the levels or that consent process?

If you don’t have any further questions, that’s all I have for you today.

Thank you so much for participating. [C], it was so nice to meet you and I hope I see you online soon to play more games.

Thank you again. Enjoy the rest of your day.
