## Abstract

## Introduction

To engage in successful social interactions, we must demonstrate social sensitivity. Concurrently, assessing the social sensitivity of others is useful in determining the desirability of social partners. The capacity to evaluate individuals on the basis of their social interactions is universal and unlearned.1 Adults routinely demonstrate and assess social sensitivity through first-order (everyday) politeness,2 but even preverbal infants develop social preferences based on individuals’ behavior towards others.1 Production and basic comprehension of polite speech presents early in development: by 3 years, children accurately judge whether an actor is more polite, ruder, nicer, or meaner than another.3 By 4 years, children reliably opt for play partners who use politeness markers and infer that speakers who use politeness markers are more likely to have their wishes granted.3 However, previous studies have not observed reliable preference for a polite speaker in children younger than 4 years, potentially due to experimental task demands. This project proposes a less challenging paradigm, which may detect preference for a polite speaker in children younger than 4 years.

Research suggests an association between social adjustment and children’s comprehension and production of polite speech.4 However, parents and educators may miss opportunities to scaffold children’s acquisition of polite speech if there is no evidence that young children possess an understanding of it. This study may provide data that justifies encouraging polite speech earlier in development, which could bolster children’s social adjustment and prevent problematic behavioral deviances later in childhood.

This study will inform our understanding of young children’s sociolinguistic development and may provide evidence for preference for a polite speaker in children younger than 4 years. Just as Surian et al. removed challenging demands from the false belief task to study perspective-taking,6 this study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of a simpler paradigm for future studies of politeness in young children. 

## Experiment 1: Preference for a polite speaker

In Experiment 1, we are testing whether 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children indicate preference for a polite speaker over an impolite speaker, based on a speaker’s employment of politeness markers as linguistic cues of politeness.

### Participants

Participants will include 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children attending preschools in the U.S. at the time of data collection. Participants will be recruited from Children Helping Science and direct outreach to preschools in the Bay Area. Children who are unable to complete test trials due to shyness, inattention, or restlessness will be excluded.

### Stimuli

The animation begins with a familiarization phase in which a speaker enters from the left, spots a cookie on the opposite side of the screen, gasps excitedly, approaches the cookie, eats it, and celebrates by jumping up and down. This phase informs the participant that the speaker’s goal is to eat the cookie.

A testing phase follows in which the speaker approaches a listener standing between the speaker and the cookie. In the polite condition, the speaker stops in front of the listener and says, “I am so hungry! May I please have a cookie?” The listener moves upstage, out of the speaker’s way. The speaker spots the cookie, crosses in front of the listener, approaches the cookie, eats it, and celebrates by jumping up and down.

The impolite condition is identical to the polite condition except for the speaker’s utterance. In the impolite condition, the speaker says, “I am so hungry! Give me a cookie now.”

The background consists of a green block and blue block depicting the grass and sky. The listener is always depicted by a blue circle. In each animation, the speakers consist of either a red triangle and yellow square or yellow triangle and red square. The shape of the speaker (triangle/square), color of the shape (red/yellow), and the order of the conditions (first/second) are counterbalanced across trials.

### Procedure

A parent will provide either written consent via email or verbal consent before testing for the child to participate in the study. Caregivers are notified that they or the child may stop participation at any time. Testing will take place online through Zoom. Test trials will be recorded with the parent’s consent. Each session will begin by testing audio quality, testing video quality, and calibrating the participant’s screen settings.

During testing, the experimenter starts by introducing the child to a green ?pentagon to introduce the concept of shapes as animate characters. The experimenter then shows the child what the character looks like when it “feels very sad” (downturned mouth), “feels normal” (flat-line mouth), and “feels very happy” (upturned, open mouth). 

After this first familiarization phase, the animation will be played which includes the polite and impolite conditions as detailed above. The experimenter will not be blind to condition but will turn off their video and mute themselves while the animation is playing. At the end of the animation, the caregiver attending to the child will be asked to close their eyes. The child will be asked, “Which friend would you like to play with?” as the polite and impolite speakers appear on opposite sides of the screen. (The side of the screen that each character appears on will be counterbalanced.) Communicative pointing or reaching behavior in younger children and verbal answers in older children will be coded equivalently as indication of preference.

If a child does not answer, the child will be prompted again: “Can you point to the friend you would like to play with?” If the child still provides no answer, the child will be prompted again: “Do you see my two friends on the screen? Can you point to the friend you would like to play with?” If the child still provides no answer, a final prompt will be provided: “There are no right or wrong answers, so you can choose which one you would like to play with.”

If the child still provides no answer, that will conclude testing.

If the child provides an answer, the child will be asked an additional question: “Why did you choose that friend?” If the child does not answer, the child will be prompted again: “Why do you want to play with that friend?”

### Analyses

A Bayesian binomial test will be conducted to determine whether the proportion of children choosing the polite speaker differs from chance.

### Results and Discussion

## Experiment 2: Sensitivity to negative politeness

In Experiment 2, we will test whether 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children exhibit a sensitivity to the concept of negative politeness: the theory that in some instances, humans use polite speech to minimize the extent that a request interferes with the listener’s freedom of action.

### Participants

Participants will include 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children attending preschools in the U.S. at the time of data collection. Participants will be recruited from Children Helping Science and direct outreach to preschools in the Bay Area. Children who are unable to complete test trials due to shyness, inattention, or restlessness will be excluded.

Half of the participants will be assigned to a “Happy Listener” condition and the other half will be assigned to an “Angry Listener” condition.

### Stimuli

The stimuli in Experiment 2 are very similar to the stimuli in Experiment 1 but have been edited slightly to create a “Happy Listener” condition and an “Angry Listener” condition. In the “Happy Listener” condition, after the listener hears the speaker’s utterance, the listener will appear happy, indicated by a smile and raised eyebrows. In the “Angry Listener” condition, after the listener hears the speaker’s utterance, the listener will appear angry, indicated by a frown and downturned eyebrows.

The familiarization phase and all other aspects of the testing phase are identical to those of Experiment 1.

### Procedure

The procedure for Experiment 2 will be identical to the procedure for Experiment 1.

Each participant will be shown be shown an animation with either (1) a polite and impolite speaker in the “Happy Listener” condition or (2) a polite and impolite speaker in the “Angry Listener” condition.

At the end of the animation, the caregiver attending to the child will be signaled to close their eyes and the child’s preference will be assessed as detailed in the procedure for Experiment 1. 

### Analyses

A Bayesian binomial test will be conducted to determine whether the proportion of children choosing the polite speaker differs from chance.

Results and Discussion

Employing politeness markers is especially important when the request interferes with the listener’s freedom of action. If a higher proportion of children prefer a polite speaker when the listener appears angered by the request than when the listener appears happy to oblige, this could be evidence for a sensitivity to the theoretical concept of negative politeness in early childhood. 


## Experiment 3: Sensitivity to status as a consideration in politeness

In Experiment 3, we will test whether 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children exhibit a sensitivity to status as a contextual consideration for politeness.

### Participants

Participants will include 2-, 3-, and 4-year-old children attending preschools in the U.S. at the time of data collection. Participants will be recruited from Children Helping Science and direct outreach to preschools in the Bay Area. Children who are unable to complete test trials due to shyness, inattention, or restlessness will be excluded.

### Stimuli

The stimuli in Experiment 3 are very similar to the stimuli in Experiment 1 but have been edited slightly to create a “Higher-Status Listener” condition and an “Lower-Status Listener” condition. In the “Higher-Status Listener” condition, the listener is visibly larger than the speaker. In the “Lower-Status Listener” condition, the speaker is visibly larger than the listener.

The familiarization phase and all other aspects of the testing phase are identical to those of Experiment 1.

### Procedure

The procedure for Experiment 3 will be identical to the procedure for Experiment 2.

Each participant will be shown be shown an animation with either (1) a polite and impolite speaker in the “Higher-Status Listener” condition or (2) a polite and impolite speaker in the “Lower-Status Listener” condition.

At the end of the animation, the caregiver attending to the child will be signaled to close their eyes and the child’s preference will be assessed as detailed in the procedure for Experiment 1. 

### Analyses

A Bayesian binomial test will be conducted to determine whether the proportion of children choosing the polite speaker differs from chance.

### Results and Discussion

Employing politeness markers is especially important when the listener is of higher status than the speaker. If a higher proportion of children prefer a polite speaker when the listener is larger than when the listener is smaller, this could be evidence for sensitivity to status as a contextual consideration for politeness in early childhood.
